This is a page where we can register users. Registration is subject to strict validation, currently we can register from Hungary, compared to this, for example, the postal code field can only be entered between 1000 and 9000. if all the data has been entered correctly, the data will be saved in a database with the help of php, with the password encrypted of course.

If you want to try it out:

1. Install XAMMP (https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html).
2. Start Apache and MySQL Services in the XAMMP Control Panel.
3. Press the Admin button in the MySQL row, this will redirect you to (http://localhost/phpmyadmin/) in the default browser.
4. Import the "frontend2209.sql" file under the database folder.
5. copy the "Register_app" folder into the "htdocs" folder of XAMMP. This is usually the path "C:\xampp\htdocs" unless you installed it somewhere else.
6. Enter the following in the url bar of the browser: (http://localhost/Register_app/).
7. Click on Register in the upper right corner, a modal dialog will be displayed where you can try the application.
